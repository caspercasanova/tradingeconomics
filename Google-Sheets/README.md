# Trading Economics Sheets Add-On — Setup Guide

This add-on connects Google Sheets to the [Trading Economics API](https://tradingeconomics.com/analytics/api.aspx), letting you pull live economic indicators, calendar events, forecasts, market data, and more directly into your spreadsheet.

## Requirements

- A Google account with access to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
- A [Trading Economics API key](https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/Home/Keys)

<br>

## Step 1 — Open the Apps Script Editor

1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2. In the menu bar, go to **Extensions → Apps Script**.

> The Apps Script editor will open in a new browser tab.

<br>

## Step 2 — Add the Script Code

1. In the Apps Script editor, click on the default **`Code.gs`** file in the left panel.
2. Delete all existing content in the editor.
3. Copy the full contents of **[`Code.gs`](Code.gs)** from this repository and paste it into the editor.
4. Press **Ctrl + S** (or **Cmd + S** on Mac) to save.

## Step 3 — Configure the Manifest (appsscript.json)

The `appsscript.json` manifest declares the OAuth permissions the add-on needs to communicate with Google Sheets and the Trading Economics API.

1. In the Apps Script editor, click **Project Settings** (the gear icon ⚙️ in the left panel).
2. Check the box labelled **"Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor"**.
3. Go back to the **Editor** view (the `<>` icon) — `appsscript.json` will now appear in the file list.
4. Click on **`appsscript.json`**, delete all existing content, and paste in the contents of **[`appsscript.json`](appsscript.json)** from this repository:

```json
{
  "timeZone": "Etc/UTC",
  "dependencies": {},
  "exceptionLogging": "STACKDRIVER",
  "runtimeVersion": "V8",
  "oauthScopes": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.storage",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request"
  ]
}
```

5. Press **Ctrl + S** (or **Cmd + S** on Mac) to save.

> The four OAuth scopes grant access to: store user properties, read/write the spreadsheet, display the sidebar UI, and make external HTTP requests to the Trading Economics API.

<br>

## Step 4 — Add the Sidebar HTML File

1. In the Apps Script editor, click the **"+"** icon next to **"Files"** in the left panel.
2. Select **"HTML"** from the dropdown.
3. Name the new file exactly **`Sidebar`** (the editor will append `.html` automatically).
4. Delete all existing content in the new file.
5. Copy the full contents of **[`Sidebar.html`](Sidebar.html)** from this repository and paste it into the editor.
6. Press **Ctrl + S** (or **Cmd + S** on Mac) to save.

> **Important:** The file must be named `Sidebar` exactly — any other name will cause the add-on to fail.

<br>

## Step 5 — Activate the Add-On

1. Go back to your Google Sheets spreadsheet and **refresh the page**.
2. After a few seconds, a new **"TE"** menu will appear in the menu bar between **"Help"** and the right edge.
3. Click **"TE"** to access the addin.

4. Start by clicking **"TE" → "Settings"** to enter your [Trading Economics API key](https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/Home/Keys).

## Notes

**Security warning on first use:**  
The first time you run the add-on, Google will display a warning: *"This app isn't verified."*

![Google unverified app warning](assets/google-unverified-warning.png)

- Click **"Advanced"**
- Click **"Go to (project name) (unsafe)"** to proceed

This warning appears because the script runs under your own Google account. The code is fully open source and visible in this repository.

**Ensure your spreadsheet has enough rows:**  
Some data requests return large result sets. Make sure your spreadsheet has at least **10,000 rows** before fetching data. To add more rows, scroll to the bottom of the sheet and click **"Add [N] more rows"**.
